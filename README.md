# File Encryption and Decryption Using Caesar Cipher (Python)

This Python program encrypts and decrypts files using the **Caesar Cipher** technique. The Caesar Cipher is a basic substitution cipher in which each character in the file is shifted by a fixed number of positions (key) in the character set.

The program allows users to securely transform file contents into an encrypted format and later restore them to their original form using the same key.

## Features
- **File Input**: Allows the user to select a file for encryption or decryption.
- **Encryption**: Shifts each character in the file by a specified key and saves the result to a new encrypted file.
- **Decryption**: Reverses the shift using the same key to recover the original file content.
- **Key-Based Security**: Requires the correct key to successfully decrypt the file.

## Limitations
- Provides basic security and is not suitable for protecting highly sensitive data.
- Works best with text-based files.
